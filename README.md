# FinEvent
Code for "Reinforced, Incremental and Cross-lingual Event Detection From Social Messages" Accepted by T-PAMI.

# Twitter Datasets
The Twitter dataset [1] is collected to evaluate social event detection methods. After filtering out repeated and irretrievable tweets, the dataset contains 68,841 manually labeled tweets related to 503 event classes, spread over a period of four weeks. To conduct the cross-lingual experiment, we additionally collect French Twitter dataset containing 64,516 labeled tweets related to 257 event classes and spread over about 3 weeks (a period of 23 days). Please find the original dataset at http://mir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/. And the description of original data is in the original_dataset_descriptions/ folder.

# Function Mode
online + offline + cross-lingual

To reduce the complicated data splitting process, we release the splitted datasets on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OCZ_OokyTA3mKe18dRSizhS0fJTcVfuD/view?usp=sharing)

## To run FinEvent Incremental
step 1. run utils/generate_initial_features.py to generate the initial features for the messages

step 2. run utils/custom_message_graph.py to construct incremental message graphs. To construct small message graphs for test purpose, set test=True when calling construct_incremental_dataset_0922(). To use all the messages (see Appendix of the paper for a statistic of the number of messages in the graphs), set test=False.

step 3. run utils/save_edge_index.py in advance to acclerate the training process.

step 4. run main.py

## To run FinEvent Offline
step 1-3 ditto (change the file path)

step 4. run offline.py

## To run FinEvent Cross-lingual
step 1-3 ditto (change the file path)

step 4. run main.py (Train a model from high-source dataset)

step 5. run resume.py

# Baselines
For Word2vec[3], we use the [spaCy pre-trained vectors](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg).

For [LDA](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html)[4], [WMD](https://tedboy.github.io/nlps/generated/generated/gensim.similarities.WmdSimilarity.html#gensim.similarities.WmdSimilarity)[5], [BERT](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)[6], [PP-GCN](https://github.com/RingBDStack/PPGCN)[7] and [KPGNN](https://github.com/RingBDStack/KPGNN.git)[2], we use the open-source implementations.

We implement EventX[8] with Python 3.7.3 and BiLSTM[9] with Pytorch 1.6.0. Please refer to the baselines folder.
